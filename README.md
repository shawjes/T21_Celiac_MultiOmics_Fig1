# Demo_T21_Celiac_GRS
 
This repository contains a copy of all non-sensitive project files for Figure 1 of the Stahl et al., 2022 manuscript, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.22280436v1.full.pdf.

For a description of each input and output file for Figure 1, please see **'/Demo_T21_Celiac_MultiOmics_Fig1/README/MEGA_041822_README_CeliacGRS_Fig1_InOut_Manifest_v0.3_JRS.xlsx'. **

Due to the Crnic team's preference, this project was initially organized and documented using a Microsoft Sharepoint folder and Microsoft Teams. Files in this demo repository represent how I delivered the project files in April 2022 before starting at Illumina. If I were doing a similar project today, I would instead use an R Project connected to a git repo, the renv package, and the here package.
