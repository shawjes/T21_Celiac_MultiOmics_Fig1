# Demo_T21_Celiac_GRS
 
Dear Guardant team,

If you are reading this, thank you very much for taking the time to attend my presentation on Wednesday. This repository contains copies of all my code, output, and documentation for the portion of research I presented to you (Figure 1 of the Stahl et al., 2022 manuscript, https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.27.22280436v1.full.pdf).

For a description of each input and output file in this repository, please see **'/T21_Celiac_MultiOmics_Fig1/README/MEGA_041822_README_CeliacGRS_Fig1_InOut_Manifest_v0.3_JRS.xlsx'. **

Due to the Crnic research team's preference, this project was initially organized and documented using a Microsoft Sharepoint folder and Microsoft Teams. Files in this demo repository represent how I delivered the project files to Dr. Stahl in April 2022 before starting at Illumina. If I were doing a similar project today, I would improve the reproducibility of my work by using an R Project connected to Git, the renv package, and the here package.

For any questions about this research or my contributions to it, please don't hesitate to reach out at jessica.rose.shaw@gmail.com or 815-975-7515.

Thank you again for attending my presentation and for your fantastic questions. It was a true pleasure talking with you all.

Best,
Jessica
